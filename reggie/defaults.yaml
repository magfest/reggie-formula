                An overwhelming majority of staffers want to work setup and teardown shifts rather than
                work during the event itself, so we have far more offers than we have need for. Since this
                affects what hotel nights staffers get, please approve and decline requests for this for
                people in your department.

                Besides the ribbons given out at registration, you may need your own ribbon type to help
                manage access to certain restricted areas. If so, please let us know what they should say,
                how many you'll need, and what color you'd like them to be. These ribbons will be given
                to you at the beginning of MAGFest to distribute to whoever needs them. (Note: Small orders
                of ribbons are very expensive - please request a ribbon type only if you need it, and tell
                us why you need it so we can make sure there's no duplication between departments.)
